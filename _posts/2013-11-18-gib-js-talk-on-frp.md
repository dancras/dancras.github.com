Last week I gave a talk on functional reactive programming at the [Gibraltar JS meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/gib-js/).

[Functional reactive programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) is a paradigm for declaratively modelling systems with values which change over time. Its concise handling of event based code is helping it find interest from engineers of both web services and user interfaces.
